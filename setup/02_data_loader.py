# MAGIC #### Data Loader
# MAGIC Copies one generated batch from the `dev.stepright.staging` volume into the
# MAGIC `dev.stepright.landing` volume, and verifies row counts per source.
# MAGIC
# MAGIC This notebook stands in for Debezium and the warehouse's nightly export — the real
# MAGIC delivery mechanisms this project doesn't have running in this course. In production,
# MAGIC these sources would land in the volume continuously and automatically.
# MAGIC
# MAGIC **Before running:** generate a batch locally with `data_generator.py`, then manually
# MAGIC upload that batch's folder into `dev.stepright.staging/batch_<n>/` using the Databricks
# MAGIC workspace UI (Catalog Explorer → dev → stepright → staging → Upload).

# COMMAND ----------

# MAGIC %sql
# MAGIC -- One-time: the staging volume, separate from landing, only used to receive
# MAGIC -- manually-uploaded batch files before we load them.
# MAGIC CREATE VOLUME IF NOT EXISTS dev.stepright.staging;

    Standard Databricks pattern for checking a path exists — dbutils.fs has no

    to raise a Python-catchable exception on a missing source — that behavior
    isn't reliable across all Databricks runtimes, and silently depending on it
    is exactly the kind of thing that works in testing and breaks later.
